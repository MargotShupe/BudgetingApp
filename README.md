# BudgetingApp

BudgetingApp will help me to track my expenses.

# Description

I created this project to track my expenses is from a tutorial on Youtube. Even though I ran into some errors that the author never mentioned I was able to debbug my code, and learn more about .eslint. In this project you will be able to use routes(pages), submit request, methods and components. Is very basic but extremely helpful for a begginer. Chris the author website is Coding in Public and he has a lot of tutorials.
